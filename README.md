# Welcome to Jesse's Interview Prep
## Hopefully you enjoy your stay and find something useful in this repo :relaxed:


### I have organized this repo so that you can click on the notes and understand the DS/Algo very simply, and that hopefully this will save you time. Good luck to everyone studying for interviews!
